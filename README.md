## Introduction
The rapid advancement of geospatial and information technology contributes significantly to human behavior research. Smartphones, equipped with built-in GPS capabilities and various sensors, enable the collection of massive amounts of high-resolution spatial-temporal data, tracking the location of individuals over specific time periods.

In this research, we will focus on developing a knowledge graph, which will function as a tool for analyzing student behavior and to analyze students’ visits to points-of-interest (POI) in Trentino.

In this project, we followed the iTelos methodology, as described in this paper. iTelos, a data integration methodology, aims for maximum flexibility in reusing both data and schemas. This goal is achieved by independently developing the data level and the schema level of an application.



## Project Purpose
The main objective of this project is to construct a knowledge graph that encapsulates the life sequences of students. This knowledge graph will serve as a powerful tool for gaining insights into various aspects of students’ daily lives. It will capture visiting points of interest, conducting events, and more, thereby providing a holistic view of student behavior.



## Project domain of interest (DoI)
This project aims to explore students’ daily lives by looking at which places they visit in their daily lives. The SmartUnitn2 dataset, which includes GPS locations of students collected via their smartphones, will be used. Our focus is specifically on locations where students stay for a duration, rather than on GPS locations that merely depict movement between places. Spatially, the domain is confined to the region of Trentino, Italy. The SmartUnitn2 dataset will be enriched with data from OpenStreetMap and “Punti di interesse del Trentino” from OpenDataTrentino. The temporal focus is on late 2016, aligning with the GPS data collection period. Annotation of places involves leveraging OpenStreetMap in June 2023 and the “Punti di interesse del Trentino” dataset from April 2014.



## Personas, Scenarios, and Competency questions
Building on the project’s main purpose outlined, this section aims to further formalize this initial purpose statement by providing scenarios and personas. These user-centered concepts represent how different users might interact with the knowledge graph. Through various scenarios and personas, we illustrate how individuals could use the knowledge graph to achieve specific goals, thus further formalizing the project’s purpose. Below, we briefly present the various personas and scenarios that were formulated. For a more detailed description, we refer you to Section 3.1 of the report.

### Scenarios and Personas

### Competency questions
Based on 8 Personas and 7 Scenarios, we started defining Competency Questions. We were able to come up with 8 competency questions.

## ER Model
From the competency questions, relating to Personas and Scenarios, we extract entities with properties. In consideration with these identified entities, we designed an Entity-relationship (ER) model as shown in the figure below.
